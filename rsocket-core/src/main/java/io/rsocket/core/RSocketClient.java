/**
 * Contract for performing RSocket requests.
 *
 * <p>{@link RSocketClient} differs from {@link RSocket} in a number of ways:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code RSocket} represents a "live" connection that is transient and needs to be obtained
 *       typically from a {@code Mono<RSocket>} source via {@code flatMap} or block. By contrast,
 *       {@code RSocketClient} is a higher level layer that contains such a {@link #source() source}
 *       of connections and transparently obtains and re-obtains a shared connection as needed when
 *       requests are made concurrently. That means an {@code RSocketClient} can simply be created
 *       once, even before a connection is established, and shared as a singleton across multiple
 *       places as you would with any other client.
 *   <li>For request input {@code RSocket} accepts an instance of {@code Payload} and does not allow
 *       more than one subscription per request because there is no way to safely re-use that input.
 *       By contrast {@code RSocketClient} accepts {@code Publisher<Payload>} and allow
 *       re-subscribing which repeats the request.
 *   <li>{@code RSocket} can be used for sending and it can also be implemented for receiving. By
 *       contrast {@code RSocketClient} is used only for sending, typically from the client side
 *       which allows obtaining and re-obtaining connections from a source as needed. However it can
 *       also be used from the server side by {@link #from(RSocket) wrapping} the "live" {@code
 *       RSocket} for a given connection.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The example below shows how to create an {@code RSocketClient}:
 *
 * <pre class="code">{@code
 * Mono<RSocket> source =
 *         RSocketConnector.create()
 *                 .metadataMimeType("message/x.rsocket.composite-metadata.v0")
 *                 .dataMimeType("application/cbor")
 *                 .connect(TcpClientTransport.create("localhost", 7000));
 *
 * RSocketClient client = RSocketClient.from(source);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The below configures retry logic to use when a shared {@code RSocket} connection is obtained:
 *
 * <pre class="code">{@code
 * Mono<RSocket> source =
 *         RSocketConnector.create()
 *                 .metadataMimeType("message/x.rsocket.composite-metadata.v0")
 *                 .dataMimeType("application/cbor")
 *                 .reconnect(Retry.fixedDelay(3, Duration.ofSeconds(1)))
 *                 .connect(TcpClientTransport.create("localhost", 7000));
 *
 * RSocketClient client = RSocketClient.from(source);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @since 1.1
 * @see io.rsocket.loadbalance.LoadbalanceRSocketClient
